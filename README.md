**Zipp**

Zipp is a lightweight, dependency‑free lossless file compression tool written in C++17. It implements a deterministic Huffman coding pipeline (frequency analysis -> tree construction -> bit‑level encoder/decoder) so that any file you compress can be decompressed back to exactly the original bytes.
